# Weekly Challenge #29 - Tech Cards

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that generates trading cards for people in tech.** When I was a child I remembered buying Panini cards of my favorite soccer players and putting them on my bed. When the documentary on React came out, somebody mentioned to me that software engineers are the superstars of today's age, so this spurred this challenge!
